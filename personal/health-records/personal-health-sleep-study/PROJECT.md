# Personal Health Sleep Study

## Overview

**Purpose**: Organize and track all personal health records, with a focus on upcoming sleep study, to create a comprehensive medical history for better healthcare management.

**Context**: This project centralizes scattered medical information and prepares for the sleep study by gathering relevant health history, symptoms tracking, and establishing a system for ongoing health record management.

**Success Criteria**: What does "done" look like?
- [ ] Complete medical history documented and organized
- [ ] Sleep study preparation completed (questionnaires, previous records gathered)
- [ ] Digital system established for ongoing health record management
- [ ] All relevant health data easily accessible for healthcare providers

## Current Status

**Status**: Active
**Progress**: 0%
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-07

### Recent Updates
- 2025-01-07: Project initiated and health records organization system established

### Next Steps
1. Gather all existing medical records and test results
2. Create sleep symptom tracking log for pre-study documentation
3. Research and prepare questions for sleep study consultation

## Project Details

### Goals
1. **Primary Goal**: Successfully organize all health records and complete sleep study preparation
2. **Secondary Goal**: Establish ongoing health tracking and record management system
3. **Stretch Goal**: Create shareable health summary for future healthcare providers

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Gathering and organizing past medical records and test results
- Creating sleep symptom diary and tracking logs
- Preparing documentation for sleep study consultation
- Setting up digital filing system for ongoing health records
- Creating medical history timeline

**Out of Scope**:
- Family members' health records (separate project)
- Detailed medical research or self-diagnosis

### Constraints
- **Time**: Complete by Q1 2025 end (March 31st) to prepare for sleep study
- **Budget**: No specific budget constraints - mostly time investment
- **Resources**: Personal time for organization, potential costs for record retrieval
- **Dependencies**: Access to past medical records from various healthcare providers

### Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Incomplete medical records | Medium | Medium | Contact all past providers early, use patient portals |
| Time constraints for organization | Medium | High | Start with most recent/relevant records first |
| Missing sleep study requirements | Low | High | Contact sleep clinic early for preparation checklist |
