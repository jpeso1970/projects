## Critical Path Analysis

**Phase 1 Critical Path**: 18 days
- Lease received → Lease signed → Move execution → Phase 1 complete

**Phase 2 Critical Path**: 100 days (fixed)
- 3-month trial period → GO/NO-GO decision

**Phase 3 Critical Path**: 45+ days (variable)
- **Print shop sale** (unknown timeline) → Roswell exit → Arkansas move
- **Risk**: Print shop may not sell quickly

**Phase 4 Critical Path**: 15+ days
- Permanent housing search (can overlap Phase 2-3) → Move-in

**Total Project Duration**:
- **Minimum** (if GO decision): ~180 days (6 months)
- **If NO-GO**: ~120 days (4 months, ends at Phase 2)

|------|--------|------------|
| Lease falls through | +1 week delay | Have backup room options |
| Weather delays drive | +2 days delay | Flexible move window Jan 10-15 |
| NO-GO decision | Project ends Phase 2 | Acceptable outcome |
| Print shop doesn't sell (Phase 3) | +2-6 months delay | Start early, use broker, adjust price |
| Roswell landlord issues (Phase 3) | +1 month delay | Early communication, maintain good standing |
| Storage coordination fails (Phase 3) | +1 week delay | Backup paid storage facility |

## Timeline Changes Log

| Date | Change | Reason | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2026-01-02 | Initial timeline created | Project initiation | Baselined 4-phase plan |

## Notes

### Timeline Management
- Update this file weekly during active phases
- Mark milestones as completed when achieved
- Document any significant timeline changes in log
- Adjust Phase 3-4 timelines based on Phase 2 decision

### Flexibility Built In
- Phase 1: 5-day move window (Jan 10-15)
- Phase 2: Fixed 3-month trial (non-negotiable)
- Phase 3: Variable based on print shop sale speed
- Phase 4: Can overlap with Phase 3 for housing search

### Key Decision Points
1. **Week of Jan 8**: Are lease terms acceptable?
2. **April 30**: GO or NO-GO on permanent California move?
3. **During Phase 3**: Is print shop sale price acceptable?
4. **During Phase 4**: Rent vs buy for permanent housing?
