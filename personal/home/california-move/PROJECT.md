# California Move - Roswell to Carlsbad Relocation

## Overview

**Purpose**: Execute a phased relocation from Roswell, GA to Carlsbad, CA, including a 3-month trial period, business exit strategy, and permanent relocation plan.

**Context**: This is not a simple move but a life transition involving:

- Dual-residence management during transition
- Strategic exit from Roswell rental and print shop business
- Family logistics with storage in Arkansas

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Phase 1: Successfully establish Carlsbad base with room rental and coworking space (January 2026)
- [ ] Phase 2: Complete 3-month trial period and make final relocation decision (January-April 2026)
- [ ] Phase 3: Sell print shop, exit Roswell rental, relocate all belongings to Arkansas storage
- [ ] Phase 4: Complete permanent move to Carlsbad with no Georgia obligations

## Current Status

**Status**: Active - Phase 1 in progress
**Progress**: 5% (awaiting lease agreement)
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-02
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Initial Partial Move (January 2026)

### Recent Updates
- 2026-01-02: Project initiated, room in Carlsbad identified

3. Drive Tesla to Carlsbad - 4-5 day cross-country trip (Jan 10-14)
4. Move in and sign up for Downtown Works coworking space (Jan 15-16)

## Project Details

### Three-Phase Strategy

#### **Phase 1: Partial Move (January 2026)** - CURRENT
**Objective**: Establish minimal viable presence in Carlsbad while maintaining Roswell base

**Key Activities**:
1. **Lease Negotiation** (Week of Jan 5)
   - Review lease terms for single room rental
   - Negotiate favorable terms
   - Sign lease agreement

2. **Cross-Country Drive** (Jan 10-14)
   - Pack only critical items
   - 4-5 day drive from Roswell, GA to Carlsbad, CA in Tesla
   - Plan Supercharger stops and overnight hotels
   - Arrive Jan 14

3. **Move-In & Setup** (Jan 14-15)
   - Unpack and set up basic living space in Carlsbad
   - Complete move-in with landlord

4. **Coworking Setup** (Jan 16+)
   - Sign up for Downtown Works membership
   - Establish remote work setup
   - Set up regular workspace routine

**Outcome**: Dual-residence situation with base in both locations

#### **Phase 2: Trial Period (January-April 2026)**
**Objective**: Validate California living and make final decision

**Duration**: 3 months

**Key Activities**:
- Live and work from Carlsbad
- Explore neighborhoods and long-term housing options
- Maintain Roswell rental house (continue paying rent)
- Assess quality of life, work setup, and overall fit
- Make GO/NO-GO decision by end of April

**Decision Point**: After 3 months, decide:
- ✅ **GO**: Proceed with permanent move → Phase 3
- ❌ **NO-GO**: Return to Roswell, abandon California plan

#### **Phase 3: Exit Strategy (If GO Decision)**
**Objective**: Cleanly exit Georgia obligations and relocate permanently

**Dependencies**: Requires Phase 2 GO decision

**Key Activities**:
1. **Sell Print Shop Business**
   - Find buyer
   - Negotiate sale terms
   - Complete business transfer
   - Handle legal/financial closing

2. **Exit Roswell Rental**
   - Give notice to landlord (timing based on lease terms)
   - Clean and prepare house for exit
   - Complete final walkthrough
   - Get security deposit returned

3. **Consolidate Belongings**
   - Sort all remaining possessions
   - Rent moving truck
   - Pack everything systematically
   - Drive to Searcy, Arkansas

4. **Arkansas Storage**
   - Arrange storage unit in Searcy
   - Coordinate with parents
   - Unload and organize in storage
   - Establish long-term storage plan

**Outcome**: No Georgia obligations, ready for permanent California move

#### **Phase 4: Permanent California Move (Post Phase 3)**
**Objective**: Establish permanent residence in Carlsbad

**Key Activities**:
- Find permanent housing (apartment/house)
- Retrieve essential items from Arkansas storage as needed
- Complete full California transition
- Establish new life routines

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Carlsbad room rental lease negotiation and signing
- Minimal initial relocation (Tesla + critical items only)
- Downtown Works coworking membership
- Maintaining dual residences for trial period
- Print shop sale process
- Roswell rental exit strategy
- Arkansas storage logistics
- Final decision-making process

**Out of Scope** (for now):
- Permanent Carlsbad housing search (deferred until after trial)
- Moving entire household initially
- Selling furniture or major items (wait for Phase 3)
- California driver's license / vehicle registration (trial period first)

### Constraints

- **Time**:
  - Lease agreement expected after January 5th
  - Move window: January 10-15
  - Trial period: 3 months (Jan-April)
  - Print shop sale timeline TBD (market dependent)

- **Financial**:
  - Dual rent payments during trial (Roswell + Carlsbad)
  - Coworking space membership cost
  - Moving costs (initial + final move)
  - Storage costs in Arkansas
  - Vehicle fuel for cross-country drives

- **Logistical**:
  - Must maintain Roswell house during trial
  - Print shop requires active sale process
  - Arkansas storage depends on parents' location
  - Work commitments throughout transition

- **Dependencies**:
  - Phase 3 cannot start until Phase 2 GO decision
  - Roswell exit depends on print shop sale completion
  - Permanent move depends on clean exit from Georgia

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Lease negotiation falls through | Low | High | Have backup room options, flexible timeline |
| Trial period yields NO-GO decision | Medium | High | Acceptable outcome - that's why we're doing trial |
| Print shop doesn't sell quickly | Medium | High | Start marketing early, consider business broker |
| Dual rent is financially unsustainable | Medium | Medium | Set budget limits, shorten trial if needed |
| Storage in Arkansas becomes problematic | Low | Medium | Have backup storage options, consider paid facilities |
| Work situation changes during move | Low | High | Maintain stable remote work setup throughout |
| Roswell landlord issues with extended rental | Low | Medium | Communicate plans early, ensure good standing |
