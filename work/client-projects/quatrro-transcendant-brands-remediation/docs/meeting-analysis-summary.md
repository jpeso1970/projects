## Executive Summary

**Situation**: Critical service delivery failure requiring CEO-level intervention. Transcendant Brands is severely at-risk due to Quatrro's inability to meet contractual obligations (10-day close). Client is performing work they're paying $10k/month for. Multiple escalations, account manager reassignment, and personnel changes underway.

**Key Problem**: Operations team unable to properly execute accounting close process, particularly cash over short and cash tips reconciliation. November close didn't finish until December 23.

**Remediation Actions**:
- Month credit discussion ($10k)
- Personnel changes on operations team
- LeaseCake implementation to reduce client workload
- Process improvements and root cause analysis
- Jeri Snyder assigned as new account manager

## Key Decisions Made

### December 1 - EDI Integration
| Decision | Who Decided | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Approve EDI integration approach | Paul & John | Reduce manual data entry, improve efficiency |
| Use R365 Vendor Connect (not inventory module) | Group decision | Already have it in core accounting, no extra cost |
| Select Kuna as pilot vendor | Paul, John, Josh | Already had ticket started, multi-state distributor |
| Continue CrunchTime in parallel | Paul (firm) | Franchise requirement, non-negotiable |
| Target vendors: Kuna, PFG, Tundra, Quantum | Paul & John | High volume vendors, biggest impact |
| Jeff Morton as primary Quatrro contact | Lucas | Technical implementation leadership |

### December 18 - Escalation Response
| Decision | Who Decided | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Escalate to Jason Pace (leadership) | Jeri Snyder | Service delivery failures, relationship at risk |
| Client will complete cash tips themselves | Paul & John | Can't wait any longer, absurd suggestions from team |
| Operations team must route through Jeri/Jeff first | Jeri | Prevent direct escalations to client |

| Schedule follow-up meeting for Dec 24 (Tue) at 11am | Group | Create process improvements plan |

### December 23 - Remediation Plan
| Decision | Who Decided | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Request 1 month credit (November ~$10k) | Paul & John | Service not delivered, client did the work |
| Escalate to CFO/CEO for approval | Jason | Credit amount requires executive approval |
| Implement LeaseCake (Quatrro provides licenses) | Jason / Jeri | Take lease work off client's plate |
| Provide base + lease accounting module | Jason | Part of service improvement |
| Allow client team member (real estate) access | Jason | Full repository and property management |
| Schedule LeaseCake kickoff post-holidays | Jason | Start implementation in January |
| Root cause analysis of cash over short | Jason / Jeri | Understand why process is failing |

## Technical Details

### Cash Tips Process (Current State - Broken)
**Problem**: Cash tips data incomplete/incorrect in Zenyo DSS feed → Team unable to reconcile → Incorrect accounting treatments suggested

**Current Manual Process**:
1. Zenyo POS captures cash sales, tips, and deposits
2. DSS feed sends data to R365 (but cash tips often incomplete or wrong)
3. Paul & John query Zenyo weekly for accurate cash tips by store/date
4. Regional manager reviews and populates gaps/corrections
5. Corrected schedule sent to Quatrro team weekly
6. These same numbers used for biweekly payroll processing (via BDO)
7. Cash tips should create liability on books
8. Liability relieved when payroll is cut (includes cash tips)
9. **Should net to zero** in month-end close

**Reconciliation Components**:
- Undeposited funds
- Cash tips liability
- Cash over short
- Bank deposits
- Payroll files (biweekly)

**Team's Error (Dec 18)**: Suggested booking cash tips to P&L (Benefits or Miscellaneous Expense) - completely incorrect

**Root Cause (Partial)**: Team not seeing cash tips in sales data, so when booking transaction, pushed to P&L to make it balance

**Proposed Solution (Dec 18)**: Team should query DSS weekly, make adjustment entry to true-up to Paul/John's schedule, adjust cash over short accordingly

### Credit Card Tips Process (Working)
- Come through Zenyo automatically
- Should match perfectly except for 2.65% processing fee that's held back
- Not a problem area

### EDI Integration Technical Details

**Vendor Connect Feature**:
- Part of R365 core accounting module (already licensed)
- NOT part of inventory or OPS modules
- Handles AP invoice imports only
- No inventory management capability

**Implementation Process**:
1. Submit vendor template form
2. Quatrro CSM (Josh) submits ticket to non-POS integrations team
3. R365 team works with vendor to set up direct integration
4. Timeline: 1-3 weeks per vendor
5. Invoices flow automatically once set up

**Vendor Status**:
| Vendor | R365 List? | Status | Priority | Notes |
|--------|------------|--------|----------|-------|
| Kuna | Yes | Ticket submitted, awaiting progress | HIGH | Pilot vendor |
| Performance Food Group | Yes | Planned after Kuna | HIGH | Simple coding |
| Quantum Distributors | No | Research needed | MEDIUM | Custom integration required |
| Tundra | Yes | Planned after Kuna | HIGH | High volume, credit memo issues |
| Cintas | Yes | Lower priority | LOW | Already on credit card |
| ServiceChannel | Yes | Already connected (FTP) | N/A | Existing integration |
| Eagle Lab | Yes | Not prioritized | LOW | Mentioned as option |

**GL Coding Approach**:
- Distributors: Code everything to inventory initially
- Month-end: Reclassify some items to supplies
- Run cost of goods calc from CrunchTime
- Reconcile R365 vs CrunchTime for discrepancies

**Parallel Systems**:
- CrunchTime: Receives electronic invoices from distributors (franchise requirement)
- R365: Will also receive same invoices via EDI
- Reconciliation: Compare both systems for discrepancies
- Manual upload: Continue for small vendors without EDI

### Lease Accounting - LeaseCake Implementation

**Current State**:
- All in Excel (schedules by location)
- Lease abstracting done internally in Excel
- No dedicated system
- Historically problematic area causing close delays

**LeaseCake Solution**:
- Base license + lease accounting module (provided by Quatrro)
- ASC 842 compliance (primary need)
- Repository for lease documents
- Lease abstracting tools
- Rent escalation notifications
- W9/COI tracking
- Property tax reminders
- Business license renewal alerts
- Access for: Paul, John, real estate team member

**Implementation**:
- Data migration from Excel
- Post-holiday kickoff (Jan 2026)
- Team to provide current Excel schedules as starting point
- Upload actual lease documents into system
- Configure abstracts and reminders

### Period Close Process

**P11 Close Issues**:
- Closed on December 23 (should have been done by mid-December)
- Major delays due to cash tips, cash over short issues
- John had to unwind errors and fix himself

**P12 Close Planning**:
- Starts January 1, 2026 (New Year's Day - holiday, not business day)
- Critical because it's year-end
- Financial review required
- Bank covenant reporting due
- Tight timeline with holidays
- High anxiety due to recent close problems

**PTO Schedule**:
- Paul: Out Dec 26-Jan 1, back Jan 2
- John: Out Dec 26 and Jan 2

**Known Issues for P12**:
- Lease possessions at end of period (John to communicate changes)
- Cash over short process still not fixed
- Team capability concerns
