## Important Context

### Service Delivery Issues
- Team missing deadlines and making errors
- Client (Paul & John) doing work they're paying for
- Multiple escalations and account manager changes
- Personnel changes being considered on Quatrro operations team
- Cash tips issue: Team suggested booking to P&L (incorrect)

### Remediation Efforts
- Jeri Snyder recently assigned as account manager
- Jason Pace involved at senior leadership level
- Root cause analysis underway
- Process improvements needed
- LeaseCake implementation to reduce client workload
- Credit discussion: 1 month free service (~$10k)

### Critical Timeline
- **Dec 23, 2025**: This meeting with Jason
- **Dec 24, 2025**: Office closes early
- **Dec 25-26, 2025**: Paul out, John out Dec 26
- **Dec 27-Jan 1, 2026**: Paul out
- **Jan 1, 2026**: P12 period starts (holiday)
- **Jan 2, 2026**: Paul returns, John out
- **Year-End 2025**: Critical close with review, bank covenants, tight timelines

### Relationship Status
