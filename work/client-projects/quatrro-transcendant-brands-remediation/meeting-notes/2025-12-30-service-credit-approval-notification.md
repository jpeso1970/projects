## Email Content

**Subject**: Status of Service Credit Approval

Good morning gentlemen, I have received full approval for the service credit of one month. I am currently looking into how this gets recognized. Can you update me on the status of your ACH payment - did you decline or is it still pending? Will let you know the procedure as soon as I hear back from our CFO.

Also, in terms of the Leasecake implementation, we're going to do a "bottom up" refresh of the abstractions using the built-in AI OCR tool so wanted to give you a heads up to locate those lease contracts - we'll provide a dropbox link as a next step.

Best,
Jason Pace
