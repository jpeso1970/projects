### 2025-12-18: Major Escalation - Cash Tips Crisis
**File**: [2025-12-18-transcendent-brands-call.md](./2025-12-18-transcendent-brands-call.md)

**Type**: 🔴 CRISIS ESCALATION MEETING
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Attendees**:
- Jeff Morton (Quatrro Technical Lead)
- Jeri Snyder (Quatrro Account Manager - recently assigned)
- John Lavigne (Transcendant Accounting Manager)
- Paul Hurley (Transcendant CFO/Controller)

**Crisis Trigger**:
- Operations team suggested booking cash tips to P&L (Benefits or Miscellaneous Expense) - completely incorrect accounting treatment
- Paul & John forced to complete cash tips reconciliation themselves
- Multiple examples of work client is performing that Quatrro should be doing

**Key Issues Discussed**:
- Cash over short process failures
- Team unable to execute properly despite training
- 10-day close commitment consistently not met (P11 still not closed as of Dec 18)
- Work falling back to client: leases, prepaid insurance, real estate taxes, rain inventory, fixed assets/CIP
- Operations team escalating problems directly to client instead of solving

**Critical Statements**:
> "I don't want to pay for the month of November because of this and a partner I would say would agree with that... I can't keep on sacrificing time with my family and my kids because we're paying over about $10,000 a month to a team that isn't getting the job done and isn't following their contractual obligations to us." - John Lavigne

> "I don't know how we can pay for a service that we're not getting honestly." - Paul Hurley

> "This is absolutely the wrong time for the close to be going sideways like this." - Paul Hurley (referring to year-end approaching)

**Key Decisions**:
- ✅ Jeri escalated situation to Jason Pace (Quatrro leadership)
- ✅ Client will complete cash tips themselves (can't wait any longer)
- ✅ Operations team must route all issues through Jeri/Jeff before contacting client
- ⏳ Personnel changes being considered
- 📅 Follow-up meeting scheduled for Dec 24 at 11am to address process improvements

**Process Explanation** (Paul's detailed walkthrough):
1. Zenyo POS captures cash sales, tips, deposits
2. DSS feed to R365 (but cash tips often incomplete/wrong)
3. Paul & John query Zenyo weekly for accurate cash tips
4. Regional manager reviews and corrects
5. Corrected schedule sent to Quatrro team weekly
6. Team should make adjustment entry to true-up
7. Cash tips create liability, relieved when payroll cuts
8. Should net to zero (no P&L impact)

**Root Cause (Preliminary)**:
- Team not understanding data flow
- Missing awareness of weekly cash tips schedule from client
- Process files may be overly complicated
- Insufficient training or wrong team assigned

**Tone**: Frustrated, confrontational, desperate, relationship severely damaged

- Brew Horizons location - calculating incentives, preparing to close
- P12 (December) period planning

**Key Decisions**:
- P12 starts January 1, 2026 (New Year's Day - holiday, not counted as business day)
- No lease updates expected P11 → P12 (but Paul noted possible lease possessions at end of P12)

**PTO Schedule Confirmed**:

- John: Out Dec 26 and Jan 2

### 2025-12-23: CEO-Level Remediation Meeting
**File**: [2025-12-23-transcendent-brands-call.md](./2025-12-23-transcendent-brands-call.md)

**Type**: 🎯 EXECUTIVE REMEDIATION MEETING (Critical)
**Duration**: ~23 minutes
**Attendees**:
- **Jason Pace** (Quatrro Senior Leadership - can escalate to CFO/CEO)
- Jeri Snyder (Quatrro Account Manager)
- Paul Hurley (Transcendant CFO/Controller)
- John Lavigne (Transcendant Accounting Manager - present)

**Context**:
- P11 (November) close just completed on Dec 23 (12 days late)
- John delivered financials by working personally through the issues
- Day before Christmas Eve, year-end approaching
- High-stakes conversation about relationship future

**Personal Connection**:
- Jason and Paul discussed car wash business (Jason was in Boston car wash business in 1990s, Paul operates 3 car washes now)
- Friendly opening despite serious topic

**Major Topics**:

#### 1. Credit Request
**Request**: 1 month credit (~$10,000 for November 2025)

**Rationale**:
- Services not delivered as contracted
- Client performed work themselves
- P11 close delivered 12 days late
- Client time investment exceeded service value

**Process**:
- Jason met with CFO (Yogesh) Dec 23 morning
- Requires CEO (Nate) approval
- Jason to submit immediately after call
- CFO may request 90-day analysis (client prefers simple 1-month credit)
- Client Position: "We could be asking for more, but this keeps it simple"

**Contract Considerations**:
- November invoice draft pending (auto-draft)
- Client considering non-payment
- Contract has dispute process for payment issues
- Jason cautioned about breach technicalities

#### 2. Service Delivery Root Cause Analysis
**Actions Underway**:
- Jason reviewing SOPs
- Jeri reviewing P11 process files (found they're "a little complicated")
- Personnel changes being considered ("need to make sure we have the right team in place")
- Process improvements needed

**Issues Identified**:
- Operations team unable to execute properly
- Wrong team may be assigned to account
- Processes may be overly complex
- No quality control before delivery to client

**Quote**:
> "This is not the experience that most of our customers have, so we'll get to the bottom of it and make sure you guys get the experience you're supposed to have." - Jason Pace

#### 3. LeaseCake Implementation (Approved)
**Decision**: ✅ Quatrro to provide LeaseCake licenses

**Details**:
- Base license + lease accounting module
- Access for: Paul, John, real estate team member
- Post-holiday kickoff (early January 2026)
- Data migration from Excel schedules
- Full feature access including property management tools

**Benefits**:
- ASC 842 compliance (automated)
- Repository for lease documents
- Rent escalation alerts
- W9/COI tracking
- Property tax and business license reminders

**Paul's Response**: Already familiar with LeaseCake, looked at it earlier but tried to keep things lean

#### 4. EDI Integration Status (Stalled)
**Problem**: No updates on Kuna EDI integration since Dec 1 approval

**Action**:
- Jeri to work with Lucas to push R365 hard
- R365 keeps client looped in before Quatrro (due to license agreement structure)
- Since client isn't hearing anything, it means nothing is happening
- Need to escalate and get timeline

**Other Vendor Discussion**:
- Tundra: High priority, credit memo reconciliation issues
- Quantum, Performance Food Group: Also priorities

#### 5. Go-Forward Commitment
**Year-End Anxiety**:
> "This is absolutely the wrong time for the close to be going sideways like this... We have the review, right? We have all kinds of timelines to get covenants to the bank, all this stuff." - Paul Hurley

**Jason's Commitments**:
- Credit decision as soon as possible (ideally same day)
- Root cause analysis to understand what's causing problems
- Personnel changes if needed
- Process stabilization
- LeaseCake implementation
- EDI progress

**Tone**: Serious, solution-focused, high-stakes but collaborative
