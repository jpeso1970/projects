**Ajay Kumar** (0:52): Hello, Jason. Hello, Jason. Hello, Rohit.
**Rohit Rawat** (0:57): Hello Abdul.
**Darshan Gurav** (0:58): Hello.
**Jeri Snyder** (2:04): Hey, Jason, you're muted.
**Ajay Kumar** (2:20): Hello Paul.
**Jeri Snyder** (2:21): Say good afternoon, Paul.
**Paul Hurley** (2:26): Hi, good afternoon.
**Jeri Snyder** (2:34): So I know Jeff is out on PTO, but we wanted to go. I mean, we still obviously need to continue and wanted to keep this call going. Is John going to be joining?
**Paul Hurley** (2:40): Yeah. Let me just ping John right now.
**Jeri Snyder** (2:49): OK.
**Paul Hurley** (3:14): Give me one second to see.
**Jeri Snyder** (3:17): No problem.
**Paul Hurley** (3:48): Just gonna run down the hall real quick. I'll be right back. I think he is. He's not in his office, so we can get started.
**Jeri Snyder** (4:08): Okay, um. So is there, I guess we'll start with you, Paul, if there's anything specifically you want to address. We have just a couple items, but I'll let you go first.
**Paul Hurley** (4:21): No, I mean my focus today has really just been on working through our biweekly payroll. I know John's doing the same. So, um, I know he is trying to, he's digging into all the cash over short entries and everything like that. Just trying to see what's going on there. So waiting for him to wrap that up so we can kind of close out Brew Horizons or at least get to the point, sorry, get to the point where we can calculate the incentives and then close Brew Horizons.
**Jeri Snyder** (4:54): OK, understood. You know on our team, I met with the team earlier today. I've started looking at that cash over short too. I know John is handling that, but I wanted to start taking a deeper dive. So I'm doing that, but in regards the.
**Paul Hurley** (5:04): Yep.
**Jeri Snyder** (5:13): In regards we wanted to also had it. We had a couple of just questions that we wanted to confirm as we move into P12 if that's fine. One is and I know it's probably more John is it doesn't the the team hasn't seen any updates or it doesn't look like there's any.
**Paul Hurley** (5:19): Yeah, yeah.
**Jeri Snyder** (5:29): Changes for leases in P from P11 to P12. So that was one question, just confirming there are no any updates on P12 for any of the leases.
**Paul Hurley** (5:45): Um, there may be, um, there's likely to be a couple lease possessions at the end of this period, so I'll just make sure that John communicates those to the team.
**Jeri Snyder** (5:50): OK. OK, no problem. That would be perfect. Thank you. And then the calendar close for period 12.
**Paul Hurley** (5:56): Yeah.
**Jeri Snyder** (6:06): It starts on. It starts on January 1st. And knowing that's a holiday, so we just wanted to make sure kind of what the the initial plan and the thought around closing period 12.
**Paul Hurley** (6:21): Yeah. So I would say because the first day falls on a holiday, I think we should just treat it kind of like we have other closes that have holidays on there and just, you know, it's not considered a business day in the close calendar.
**Jeri Snyder** (6:32): OK. Thought that's where you wanted to go, but I wanted to be absolutely certain and not make that assumption.
**Paul Hurley** (6:40): No, I appreciate you asking.
**Jeri Snyder** (6:43): OK.
**Paul Hurley** (6:46): But.
**Jeri Snyder** (6:49): Um. I believe that's the only open items I at this point that I have heard from the team.
**Paul Hurley** (7:05): OK. Yeah, no, sounds good. So hopefully we'll be at a point where we can calculate out the Brew Horizons incentive, get this, get this all wrapped up just because we're in the office today, tomorrow, half of Wednesday and then I am going to be out from the 26th through the end of the year.
**Jeri Snyder** (7:15): OK.
**Paul Hurley** (7:21): So I will be back on. I will be back on the 2nd.
**Jeri Snyder** (7:25): OK. And then I know John will be available. Is he going to be working? Is he going to be available on the 26th?
**Paul Hurley** (7:34): Yes. So John is gonna be off on the 26th and the 2nd, so I'll be here on the 2nd. We're both gonna be off on the 26th. Other than that, John is here with the exception of holidays, yeah.
**Jeri Snyder** (7:42): OK. OK. OK. OK. All right. Good to know. Yeah. Just making sure that we have coverage while you guys are on. Yeah.
**Paul Hurley** (7:53): Yeah. Um. Perfect.
**Jeri Snyder** (8:03): OK. All right. Well, that was, uh. Pretty, pretty clean, so all right.
**Paul Hurley** (8:10): Yeah. All right. Yeah. So, yeah, I'll John communicate. John will communicate when he's all set with the cash flow for short and then hopefully that will be soon. I know he was really digging into it this morning. OK.
**Rohit Rawat** (8:30): Thanks. Bye, bye everyone.
**Abhishek Ramashish Maurya** (8:30): And.
