**Paul Hurley** (0:08): Jason.
**Jason Pace** (0:11): Good morning.
**Paul Hurley** (0:12): Hey, how you doing, Jason? Yeah, Jon, Jon and I are together consolidating.
**Jason Pace** (0:15): Hey, John. Hey, Paul.
**Paul Hurley** (0:18): Hello.
**Jason Pace** (0:20): Merry Christmas, Christmas Eve. Merry Eve of Christmas Eve. How about that?
**Paul Hurley** (0:26): Yeah, same.
**Jason Pace** (0:27): Something like that. I still don't have like I like.
**Paul Hurley** (0:27): Same for you.
**Jason Pace** (0:31): Maybe tomorrow. I'll. I'll think of like what I forgot to do, you know?
**Paul Hurley** (0:37): Oh yeah, I'm right there with you. I still got stuff to wrap, still got a few gifts to get my family members before I travel to go see them. I'm trying to keep Chicago.
**Jason Pace** (0:49): Where you going? Oh, OK. And you guys are in Boston right now?
**Paul Hurley** (0:53): I'm trying to. We're in Boston, yeah. Fortunately, our flight's Friday night and it was looking like we were gonna get a bad weather day, but it looks like it's all gonna happen overnight on Friday. So hopefully we'll get out of here.
**Jason Pace** (0:56): OK, cool. Cool. I just real. Oh. Oh, that's good. That's good. I just noticed you guys opened a car wash or not open, but you have a car wash or do you have more than one?
**Paul Hurley** (1:09): Sorry you. We do. We have 3 car washes. We have one in Rhode Island and two in Massachusetts. One of them is like an unmanned like in Bay automatic car wash.
**Jason Pace** (1:23): Yeah.
**Paul Hurley** (1:24): So that's our sister company to Brew Horizons.
**Jason Pace** (1:25): Yep.
**Paul Hurley** (1:27): So that's why I like Transcendent Brands is the parent company that sits over both of those entities.
**Jason Pace** (1:28): OK. I used to be in the car wash business in Boston a long time ago. You guys remember Sonny's?
**Paul Hurley** (1:39): Yeah, yeah.
**Jason Pace** (1:42): Yeah.
**Paul Hurley** (1:44): Not the, not that. At least I don't think. Like what? What area?
**Jason Pace** (1:50): So they had Revere Malden.
**Paul Hurley** (1:54): Yeah.
**Jason Pace** (1:55): Oh gosh, like three other places. Reading.
**Paul Hurley** (1:59): Yeah, all North Shore, right.
**Jason Pace** (2:01): Yeah, yeah, up there.
**Paul Hurley** (2:02): I think it was different, not.
**Jason Pace** (2:04): And then they had several down in Florida. So we had 92 locations across the country before I left and we started with four. So that was quite an adventure. Yeah, back in the 90s, mid 90s.
**Paul Hurley** (2:15): Wow. Yeah.
**Jason Pace** (2:19): So yeah.
**Paul Hurley** (2:20): Yeah. It's an interesting business.
**Jason Pace** (2:23): Well, it's changed a lot too.
**Paul Hurley** (2:25): Yeah, the technology has changed significantly, right? But some of the same old damage claim customer stuff will never change.
**Jason Pace** (2:36): No it doesn't. But like the whole dynamic around like so the ones we all had were full service with detail and quick lube. Now the concept of course is like drive through self-service and membership based. You know like back then I wouldn't have dreamed of 60% of my customers being signed up on a membership.
**Paul Hurley** (2:50): Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah.
**Jason Pace** (2:57): That would have been incredible and not having all the labor that comes with full service. So anyway, I know that's not today's topic, but I just noted that on your account it may be nostalgic for Boston and car washing and all that kind of stuff anyway.
**Paul Hurley** (3:04): Right, right.
**Jason Pace** (3:16): Back to the business at hand, gentlemen.
**Paul Hurley** (3:19): Yep.
**Jason Pace** (3:21): Let's see. We got two things to talk about today. I had put an early appointment this morning on our CF OS calendar. He downloaded to me the typical process. Went through the contract terminology and stuff like that so. What he told me and he gave me the approval thresholds and all that sort of thing. I relayed all of the stuff we talked about earlier in the week, early in the week. No last week to him, so he's aware. As you know, our Chief Operating Officer, Myrly was already aware also. So what Jerry and the team are going to do is they're going to go backwards about 90 days and just kind of try to reconstruct like what did we deliver that you had to potentially rework or what did we not deliver and put some sort of number on that. And then you know, I don't want to create a ton of work for you guys. I know that's a pain in the neck, but like if you want to put together like just an order of magnitude of what you think it is. That lets me move forward in our process and you know, keeps everything on the rails with that. So anyway, I'll stop there if you guys have any reactions or questions to that.
**Paul Hurley** (4:36): Yeah, well, my reaction, hopefully, I was hoping that we could keep it kind of simpler than that. I think everyone's aware of what was and wasn't done and how long this close has taken and what happened with previous closes, but I also you know anybody drawn to chime in and give us thoughts as well. Yeah, I mean, I was just hoping that, you know, keep it simple. Just give us a month free and then we move on from there, right? Like I and, you know, going back 90 days. It hasn't been, you know, a 90 day sort of issue. You know, it's been progressive since the relationship almost started. That it's really. I you know, if I want to consider this like a partnership, I think it's more like hey, yeah, you know, you know, we've been having all these struggles. We're trying to make it better. Let's just say November is done because you know, November is free because you know, John had John's delivering financials on the 23rd of December because he had to kind of unwind all of the issues that were associated with certain accounts and he had to fix a lot of these errors and you know, things that are complex I would. I'll, I'll give you that there the you know at least accounting is complex. But I mean, you know, you know, it's just disheartening in a way. When Paul and I are having a conversation and the end of the conversation is, yeah, you're gonna probably have to get this over the finish line. Right? And that's where we currently are and that's because of the situation we've been in for.
**Jason Pace** (6:17): Yep, understandable.
**Paul Hurley** (6:25): The last you know, 14 months. That's my target. Yeah, we get. Yeah. And yeah, I concur with that to keep it simple just because again.
**Jason Pace** (6:30): Yeah. OK.
**Paul Hurley** (6:36): John and I have spent more resources on our side than that amount, right? I mean when you consider how much time that we've had to put in and not being able to work on other things in the hours that we put in, I mean between time him and I are putting is higher than, you know, is higher than, you know.
**Jason Pace** (6:48): Yeah. I'm with you. All right.
**Paul Hurley** (6:53): What I mean, quite frankly, we could be asking for more, but that just keeps it simple, right?
**Jason Pace** (6:55): Well, then I'll.
**Paul Hurley** (6:59): So I would hope that you guys would agree there's a draft pending on our side right now in our account. So we need to figure out what to do with it because we have a kind of exception based drafting right through positive pay and so that needs to be decisioned on our side. So just figure out how to how to do it afterward memo.
**Jason Pace** (7:19): Well, yeah. So let me react with two things. First of all, I'll consider your estimate submitted. I'll send that up to chain at that level requires the CEO approval. So I can't tell you yet on the phone, but I'll take these notes and forward them up just like we're supposed to. So as far as the draft is concerned. I mean, listen, you guys can do what you want. The terms of the contract have a provision for disputing services and payment. What would you call it? And so, I mean, I know you guys wouldn't willfully or want to be in breach of over something like this. So just read the details on that if you want me to send you those. There's a process for.
**Paul Hurley** (8:15): Jason, aren't we technically, are you in breach from a service standpoint? I mean, in all honesty.
**Jason Pace** (8:20): Not technically on the contract, I don't think so, no.
**Paul Hurley** (8:22): Well, how did so 10 day close was achieved?
**Jason Pace** (8:26): Well, not saying that we haven't failed from a service perspective ever, just from the standpoint of the way the process is laid out in the agreement. There's a process and I don't want you guys to fail on a technicality. And neither do you. So I just wanted to bring it up. But you can handle it however you want to. And this is just me, just making sure you guys know about that provision. But yeah, you've told us that we're certainly in that you know that you feel like the service hasn't been delivered, so that box is checked. But the way the agreement reads is there's a dispute process for paying invoices, which frankly I don't understand if it's on auto draft, so take a look at it because you guys actually don't pay us, we draft it.
**Paul Hurley** (9:23): Yep.
**Jason Pace** (9:24): But yeah anyway.
**Paul Hurley** (9:27): All right. So I think the simplest way to handle this is honestly, can you guess an answer on this credit today?
**Jason Pace** (9:35): I will try. I will send the notes immediately after this call up to Yogesh, who will discuss it with Nate, and I will get an answer back to you on that as soon as I hear from him. Not sure if they'll approve it today, but I will do my best.
**Paul Hurley** (9:54): All right. We just need to know where we're heading and like the other thing besides the credit, I'm just surprised like the team after all the stuff with the cash over short. I'm just concerned about go forward, right? Because we hear a lot of things, and we're talking about credit for the past, but I'm more concerned honestly with where do we go from here and how does this get better? And I'm surprised the team.
**Jason Pace** (10:16): Oh yeah, me too. We're on the same page.
**Paul Hurley** (10:19): No one is coming forward with any proposals or doing any further digging into this cash over short issue. I mean, we're gonna be dealing with this again in just over a week and I don't see any momentum at all. Like honestly.
**Jason Pace** (10:37): Well, there's plenty of discussion behind the scenes on this. Obviously we need to line our ducks up and figure out why we were having the problem in the first place. I've been diving into the SOPs to try to make some sort of contribution to it as well, so it's not that there's nothing being done, it's just that you're not seeing it, but point taken. I believe we do need to come back to you with a more formal sort of remediation plan if you will. But I also need to dig into what's the root cause? I don't understand yet what's causing the problem, but Jerry and myself and Jeff and I are all certainly trying to get to the bottom of it. Obviously, we feel and we've discussed this last week that we need to make some personnel changes because the process is not being followed and mistakes are being made which is causing these errors that is causing you to have to make the corrections. So we've got to go backwards to figure out what's causing that.
**Jeri Snyder** (11:46): Yeah, and just on that note, as Jason stated, you know there's some things going on yesterday. I actually had the team send me all of the files that they used for period 11 and I started digging through those files so behind the scenes I was doing that. And one thing just for back to Jason talking about looking at the SOPs, one thing I found is that the files that we're using, it's a little complicated. So I don't know if internally we've made it more complicated than it needs to be and so that's part of the process is digging through those and looking at seeing what they did and where it's maybe getting them hung up. Which is why they didn't, you know why there were still questions to the both of you on the cash over short. And I did ask the team when I saw that you had stated that it was closed if they could provide me with the cash over short entry that you booked so that I could then look at it as well from the standpoint of looking at it compared to what their file said. So behind the scenes I was doing some digging and you know yesterday, to try to see where I can help them out.
**Jason Pace** (13:05): Yeah, we'll get to the bottom of what's causing it and get it stabilized. I don't have any doubt about that.
**Paul Hurley** (13:12): OK.
**Jason Pace** (13:14): Again, like this is just a very, to me, this is a very unusual situation altogether.
**Paul Hurley** (13:15): Yeah, I mean and we.
**Jason Pace** (13:20): This is not the experience that most of our customers have, so we'll get to the bottom of it and make sure you guys get the experience you're supposed to have the experience we want you to have as quickly as possible.
**Paul Hurley** (13:32): And I just want you to hear this. I mean, John and I have said throughout the term of the engagement too, just in case you hear something different, we have always asked, hey, you know we are doing things. We have schedules that we brought to you guys because this is the way that we did it before that we had you guys. We have constantly asked, hey, if you have any best practices, any synergies, anything that you can do to enhance this? Make the process better. Make it more of your own, but still accomplishing our goals.
**Jason Pace** (14:06): Yeah.
**Paul Hurley** (14:06): We asked the team to really have at it and I don't know, John. I don't know if we actually got, like really anything from that. So like I hope that the team won't tell you that the schedules are too complicated because we made it too complicated for them. We've actually encouraged the team. We've actually encountered.
**Jason Pace** (14:25): Yeah. Well, we would love the opportunity to simplify it. And the great news is that Jerry is really the perfect person to lead that effort.
**Paul Hurley** (14:27): Yeah.
**Jeri Snyder** (14:30): Yes.
**Jason Pace** (14:34): So you know, first thing of course, just getting it stable to where we're doing what we're supposed to be doing and then start to look at improving it because improving it improves it for all of us. We spend less time on it and you guys get what you want better, faster, quicker.
**Paul Hurley** (14:52): Agreed. Agreed. Yeah, I think we're on the same.
**Jason Pace** (14:55): Yeah, yeah, cool. All right. So that covers that. I will do my best to get a response from you guys today, most likely the CFO is going to be asking for the analysis from our team. I don't know how quickly they'll be able to put that together. So moving on to lease accounting, can we do that?
**Paul Hurley** (15:21): Yeah, sure.
**Jason Pace** (15:22): All right, so we're proposing to put you guys on LeaseCake. We're going to provide the licenses. We believe that the perfect trifecta of technology is LeaseCake, R365, and WORKSTREAM. So plugging in LeaseCake into this gives us two out of three. I don't know how you guys do payroll HR, we can talk about that some other day, but LeaseCake is our go-to choice for lease accounting. The implementation's actually not that hard. It's got a really super slick interface.
**Paul Hurley** (15:51): OK.
**Jason Pace** (15:52): But the big question that starts off that conversation is where is your lease information now? Is it all in soft copy? Do you have a database? Do you have anything at all that you use like a tool or anything like that? Because the first step is really just a data migration of all your leases into the system.
**Paul Hurley** (16:10): No. Tall Mansion Excel file. All with all the respective schedules by Stan. By location. Yeah. And all the lease abstracting was done internally and a lot of that is also within Excel files. So not like any other system to kind of like migrate from. But I know LeaseCake has.
**Jason Pace** (16:13): OK. Oh. OK.
**Paul Hurley** (16:32): Like a myriad of other great features that are not like accounting related, right?
**Jason Pace** (16:37): It really does.
**Paul Hurley** (16:40): They're more kind of like property management related.
**Jason Pace** (16:42): Yeah.
**Paul Hurley** (16:44): Would we have access to those as well? Those?
**Jason Pace** (16:44): Yep. Yeah. So there's certain, yes. And then there's certain features that they have that are like extra super special that there's a slight add on for what we're gonna provide you guys as part of your license is the base LeaseCake license plus the lease accounting module.
**Jeri Snyder** (16:47): Yes. Yeah.
**Paul Hurley** (16:49): OK.
**Jason Pace** (17:01): License that goes on top of it.
**Paul Hurley** (17:03): Would we be able to?
**Jason Pace** (17:03): So we're providing you.
**Paul Hurley** (17:05): Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
**Jason Pace** (17:05): Now we're just so all the features that are included in the base plus the lease accounting module will be available to you. And then anything else you want to choose Chinese menu style on top of that, we can totally work with you guys on that.
**Paul Hurley** (17:07): Sorry, I don't want to call you.
**Jason Pace** (17:20): I mean it's literally dollars in the single digits per location per month usually.
**Paul Hurley** (17:27): So just for the base access though, would we?
**Jason Pace** (17:28): So.
**Paul Hurley** (17:33): So we do have a real estate person. Would we be able? How do you envision the access? Would it just be me and John have accounts or would we people have our real estate person that OK and they could upload reschedules do abstracting through that and everything?
**Jason Pace** (17:42): No, they can have an account too. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, of course. Yeah, you bet.
**Jeri Snyder** (17:49): Yes.
**Jason Pace** (17:51): Have you guys seen it before?
**Paul Hurley** (17:52): OK, OK.
**Jason Pace** (17:52): Have you seen the demo of it?
**Paul Hurley** (17:53): Oh yeah, no, we've done demos on it. I mean we were.
**Jason Pace** (17:56): Oh, OK.
**Paul Hurley** (17:57): We looked at it very, very early on. But you know, trying to keep things lean at the time and we didn't end up going for it, but it is a pretty slick system like you say.
**Jason Pace** (18:11): Yeah. Well, then it's good timing for all of us. So yeah, I guess what we need to do then is I've already given LeaseCake a heads up, told them that we'd be starting a new implementation. And of course I know their next question is gonna be well, where's the data? So we need to probably set up a formal kickoff with them after the holidays most likely. But you know any and all data you guys can kinda gather up.
**Paul Hurley** (18:35): OK.
**Jason Pace** (18:41): And stage for us. That would be great. They would love to see that sooner than later, and we'll get that going.
**Jeri Snyder** (18:51): And we have those schedules, right? So we could even provide that what the team is working from as a start. Obviously that's what you're talking about, right?
**Paul Hurley** (19:00): Right, I think that would be the starting.
**Jeri Snyder** (19:02): Is those schedules? Yeah.
**Paul Hurley** (19:03): Yeah, I think that would be the starting point. And then if there's any other things that we can backfill in with like as far as abstracting or anything from the property side?
**Jeri Snyder** (19:17): Right. Yeah. Yes. 'Cause we'll want to have the actual leases in there so that you have it because it's the repository for them, right? So you can actually put those in there and you can pull them up at any time, but then the abstracts will go in there as a separate piece. And so I would say that we'll we can start with that Excel file and then from there we can get the leases actually dropped into LeaseCake because as a prior user of LeaseCake there were.
**Paul Hurley** (19:37): Yeah, yeah. OK.
**Jeri Snyder** (19:49): Definitely things I did like you guys asked about outside of even just tracking the leases and the ASC 842 piece.
**Paul Hurley** (19:54): Right.
**Jeri Snyder** (19:56): Which was for me, as in your shoes, that was the most important part, but it actually had some other advantages to it as well.
**Paul Hurley** (20:02): Yeah. Yeah, like I know they had notifications about rent escalations and things like that that would just keep you on track rather than hearing from a landlord, whether it's like W9 or COI information and stuff like that. It's a pretty good management tool.
**Jeri Snyder** (20:09): Yes. Yes. Yes, I used it even to remind us of, yes, besides rent escalations.
**Paul Hurley** (20:21): Cool.
**Jeri Snyder** (20:27): But remind things like tangible personal property taxes were due or business license updates. Just to let us know that, hey, it's time to renew the business license.
**Paul Hurley** (20:36): Right, right.
**Jeri Snyder** (20:36): Just some things that you it's just another piece that I use them for besides just standard leases. So it's very helpful.
**Paul Hurley** (20:44): Yeah. OK, Jerry. Sorry not to change the subject, but do we have an update?
**Jeri Snyder** (20:51): Sure.
**Paul Hurley** (20:52): What is the current EDI situation with that? We wanted to test. I think we were gonna try Kuna. Do you know where we stand with that? We haven't really heard anything from Lucas.
**Jeri Snyder** (21:02): My understanding on the EDI was that for one, Restaurant 365 is keeping you looped in and they actually keep you looped in before we do because of the way your license agreement works with them. I even asked Lucas, I said, you know, what's the latest update on the EDI? And he said, well, you know, they're getting contact information from Restaurant 365, probably even before we do. So with that being said, since you're not getting any updates, we need to go and I'll work with Lucas to push Restaurant 365 on where is the latest update on these EDI files. Because if you guys aren't hearing, then that's really, you know, that speaks volumes.
**Paul Hurley** (21:47): Right. OK. Yeah, I was just curious. We haven't really heard anything in a while.
**Jeri Snyder** (21:52): Yeah, and that's not good because that's not what we were told.
**Jason Pace** (21:56): What vendors are we talking about?
**Paul Hurley** (21:59): We were talking about kinda starting with our distributors, Kuna, Quantum Distributors, Performance Food Group and then Tundra if we can, yeah.
**Jeri Snyder** (22:10): Oh yeah yeah. Tundra would be good too.
**Paul Hurley** (22:13): Yeah.
**Jason Pace** (22:13): Huh.
**Paul Hurley** (22:15): It's our biggest issue with them is around credit memos. Tundra we have a bit. I mean, we get these statements, credit memos, but no credit memos to be found anywhere, right? So try to have the team close down and it's. Yeah. So, yeah, I just wanted to inquire about that.
**Jason Pace** (22:26): Right. All right. OK.
**Jeri Snyder** (22:32): I appreciate that. Yeah. So well, yep.
**Jason Pace** (22:33): We'll make a note of that, yeah.
**Paul Hurley** (22:36): Yeah.
**Jason Pace** (22:37): Good. All right, gentlemen. I'll give you an update midday-ish. It's almost midday, but I'll let you know what to expect on the credit. I'll just see if Yogesh will fast track.
**Paul Hurley** (22:49): OK. OK.
**Jason Pace** (22:52): A month's fees and if he can get that approved, and if not, that just means he wants the team to go back and do some homework on quantifying this. And you know he's a CFO so.
**Paul Hurley** (22:55): OK.
**Jason Pace** (23:05): You know, you know the drill.
**Paul Hurley** (23:06): Gotcha. All right. Yep, all right. I appreciate it.
**Jason Pace** (23:11): Yep, you bet. You bet. You can call me anytime. Call Jerry anytime. If we don't speak before the holidays.
**Jeri Snyder** (23:15): Appreciate it guys.
**Paul Hurley** (23:15): Sounds good.
**Jason Pace** (23:17): Have a Merry Christmas.
**Paul Hurley** (23:19): Likewise, you too.
**Jeri Snyder** (23:19): Yes.
**Paul Hurley** (23:20): Thank you. Thank you. Thank you both.
**Jason Pace** (23:20): All right. Take care, guys. Bye bye.
**Jeri Snyder** (23:20): Thank you.
