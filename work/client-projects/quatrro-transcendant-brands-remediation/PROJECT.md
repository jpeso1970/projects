# Quatrro - Transcendant Brands Client Remediation

## Overview

**Purpose**: Execute urgent remediation plan to retain Transcendant Brands as a key Quatrro client following severe service delivery failures. This is a CRITICAL at-risk situation with CEO-level escalation requiring immediate corrective action.

**Context**: Transcendant Brands (Seven Brew franchise operator + car washes, ~$10k/month client) is at-risk of churning due to consistent failure to meet contractual obligations (10-day close). Client is performing work they're paying for, threatened non-payment, and escalated to executive leadership. Root causes: operations team unable to execute, process failures, particularly around cash over short and month-end close.

**Success Criteria**: What does "done" look like?
- [x] Root cause analysis initiated (Jason/Jeri - Dec 23)
- [x] Executive leadership engaged (Jason Pace, CFO, CEO - Dec 23)
- [x] Credit approved and applied (~$10k November credit - Approved Dec 30)
- [ ] Cash over short process fixed and documented
- [ ] Personnel changes implemented on operations team
- [ ] LeaseCake implemented to remove lease work from client
- [ ] 3 consecutive 10-day closes achieved
- [ ] Year-end 2025 close completed successfully
- [ ] Client confirms continued partnership
- [ ] EDI integration delivering value (Kuna + 2 more vendors)
- [ ] No work falling back to client - full service delivery

### Problem Statement

**Service Delivery Failures** (14+ months):
- **10-Day Close**: Contracted commitment consistently not met (P11 closed on Dec 23, should have been mid-December)
- **Cash Over Short**: Team unable to properly reconcile, suggested absurd accounting treatments
- **Cash Tips**: Team couldn't handle, client forced to do themselves
- **Leases**: Historically problematic, causing close delays
- **Work Falling to Client**: Prepaid insurance, real estate taxes, rain inventory, fixed assets/CIP, cash reconciliation
- **Execution Quality**: Wrong GL coding, not following instructions, missing requirements
- **Communication**: Operations team escalating problems directly to client instead of resolving

**Financial Impact**:
- Client paying ~$10k/month but not receiving contracted services
- Client performing work they're paying for
- Time cost: Paul & John spending more time than $10k value

**Relationship Impact**:
- Trust severely damaged
- Multiple escalations and account manager changes (Ganesha → Jeri)
- CEO-level intervention required
- Contract breach and non-payment discussed

### Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Retain Transcendant Brands through immediate service stabilization and trust rebuilding
2. **Secondary Goal**: Achieve consistent 10-day closes and full service delivery
3. **Tertiary Goal**: Implement automation improvements (EDI, LeaseCake) to prevent future issues
4. **Stretch Goal**: Transform into case study for successful remediation and account turnaround

### Scope

**In Scope**:
- Cash over short process redesign and stabilization
- Cash tips reconciliation process documentation and training
- Lease accounting transition to LeaseCake
- EDI integration implementation (Kuna, PFG, Tundra, Quantum)
- Operations team personnel changes and training
- Root cause analysis and process improvements
- Credit negotiation (~$10k for November)
- Regular status reporting and stakeholder management
- Documentation of all work client has taken back
- Proactive communication protocols (route through Jeri/Jeff)
- Year-end close success (P12)

**Out of Scope**:
- Florida sales tax (client handles themselves, not in contract)
- Other Quatrro clients (focus only on Transcendant)
- Long-term account growth (focus on retention first)
- Business consulting beyond accounting services

### Constraints

- **Time**: EXTREMELY time-sensitive
  - Year-end close in January (high-stakes, review, bank covenants)
  - Client patience exhausted - need immediate visible progress
  - Period 12 starts Jan 1, 2026 (10-day target = Jan 11)

- **Budget**:
  - $10k/month contract value
  - ~$10k credit being requested/approved
  - LeaseCake licenses (Quatrro absorbing cost)

- **Resources**:
  - Jason Pace (senior leadership time)
  - Jeri Snyder (recently assigned, learning account)
  - Jeff Morton (technical lead, multiple responsibilities)
  - Operations team (current team may not be capable)
  - Client time (Paul & John availability limited around holidays)

- **Technical Dependencies**:
  - R365 non-POS integrations team (EDI progress)
  - LeaseCake implementation team
  - CrunchTime must continue (franchise requirement - non-negotiable)
  - Zenyo POS data quality issues

- **Holiday Constraints**:
  - Paul out: Dec 26-Jan 1
  - John out: Dec 26 and Jan 2
  - Limited availability Dec 24-Jan 2

## Current Initiatives

### Initiative 1: Cash Over Short Process Fix (CRITICAL)

**Status**: 🔴 IN CRISIS - Process broken, client doing work themselves
**Owner**: Jeri Snyder
**Timeline**: Immediate - must be fixed before P12 close

**Problem**:
- Team unable to properly reconcile cash over short
- Suggested booking cash tips to P&L (completely incorrect)
- Causing multi-day delays in every close
- Client forced to complete themselves

**Root Causes** (Preliminary):
- Team not understanding full process flow
- Missing data sources (Zenyo DSS incomplete for cash tips)
- Process files may be overly complicated
- Training insufficient
- Team may not be right fit

**Current Process** (What Should Happen):
1. Zenyo POS captures: cash sales, cash tips, credit tips, deposits
2. DSS feed sends data to R365 (but cash tips often incomplete/wrong)
3. Paul & John query Zenyo weekly for accurate cash tips by location/date
4. Regional manager reviews, populates gaps, makes corrections
5. Corrected cash tips schedule sent to Quatrro team weekly
6. Team should:
   - Query what came through DSS
   - Make adjustment entry to true-up to Paul/John's schedule
   - Adjust cash over short accordingly
   - Create cash tips liability on balance sheet
7. Same cash tips numbers used for biweekly payroll (via BDO)
8. Payroll processing relieves cash tips liability
9. **Result**: Should net to zero, no P&L impact

**Reconciliation Components**:
- Undeposited funds
- Cash tips liability
- Cash over short
- Bank deposits
- Payroll files (biweekly)

**Solution** (Proposed):
- Document proper process step-by-step
- Train team on full data flow (Zenyo → DSS → R365 → Payroll)
- Weekly adjustment entries based on client's schedule
- Reconciliation checklists
- Consider personnel changes if training doesn't work

**Success Metrics**:
- Cash over short completed by Day 3 of close (vs current Day 10+)
- Zero errors requiring client intervention
- Team executes without escalation to Paul/John
- Process documented and repeatable

### Initiative 2: LeaseCake Implementation

**Status**: 🟡 APPROVED - Implementation starting January 2026
**Owner**: Jeri Snyder / Jeff Morton
**Timeline**: Kickoff post-holidays, completion by mid-February

**Purpose**:
- Remove lease accounting workload from client
- Fix historically problematic area
- Provide better tools for lease management
- Demonstrate commitment to service improvement

**Current State**:
- All lease data in Excel (schedules by location)
- Lease abstracting done manually in Excel
- Historically causes close delays
- Client managing themselves due to team failures

**Solution**:
- Quatrro providing LeaseCake licenses (base + lease accounting module)
- Access for: Paul, John, real estate team member
- Full feature access (base features + lease accounting)

**Benefits**:
- ASC 842 compliance (automated)
- Repository for lease documents
- Lease abstracting tools
- Automated alerts: rent escalations, renewals, expirations
- W9/COI tracking
- Property tax reminders
- Business license renewal tracking

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Post-holiday kickoff meeting (early January)
2. Data migration from Excel schedules (Jeri's team has current schedules)
3. Upload actual lease documents into system
4. Configure abstracts and alerts
5. Training for Paul, John, real estate team
6. Month-end integration with R365
7. First use: P1/P2 2026

**Success Metrics**:
- All leases migrated and accessible
- Lease accounting automated (no client intervention)
- Zero close delays due to leases
- Client satisfaction with tool

### Initiative 3: EDI Integration for AP Automation

**Status**: 🔴 BLOCKED - Kuna pilot stalled, no R365 updates since Dec 1
**Owner**: Jeff Morton / Lucas Felak
**Timeline**: Kuna pilot was 1-3 weeks, now unclear

**Goal**:
- Automate AP invoice imports from major vendors
- Reduce manual data entry for Quatrro team
- Improve efficiency and accuracy
- Free team time for reconciliation and review work

**Approved Dec 1, 2025**:
- Use R365 Vendor Connect feature (already licensed in core accounting)
- Start with Kuna distributor as pilot
- Plan rollout to PFG, Tundra, Quantum after pilot success
- Reconcile R365 vs CrunchTime for discrepancies

**Vendor Status**:
| Vendor | R365 EDI Available? | Priority | Status | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|----------|---------|-------|
| Kuna | Yes | HIGH | 🔴 Ticket submitted Dec 1, no updates | Multi-state, pilot vendor |
| Performance Food Group | Yes | HIGH | ⏸️ Awaiting Kuna pilot | Simple GL coding |
| Tundra | Yes | HIGH | ⏸️ Awaiting Kuna pilot | High volume, credit memo issues |
| Quantum Distributors | No | MEDIUM | 🔍 Research needed | Custom integration required |
| Cintas | Yes | LOW | ⏸️ Lower priority | Already on credit card |
| ServiceChannel | Yes | ✅ Already connected | FTP/batch daily |

**Technical Approach**:
- Vendor Connect pulls invoices automatically
- GL coding rules configured (distributors → inventory initially)
- Month-end reclassifications as needed (some to supplies)
- Cost of goods from CrunchTime
- Reconcile R365 vs CrunchTime for discrepancies
- Manual upload continues for small vendors

**Current Blocker**:
- R365 non-POS integrations team not responding/progressing
- No updates through support portal
- Jeff/Lucas not hearing back
- Client asked about status Dec 23 - embarrassing lack of progress

**Action Required**:
- Jeri to work with Lucas to push R365 hard
- Escalate within R365 if needed
- Get timeline commitment
- Consider alternatives if R365 continues to stall

**Success Metrics**:
- Kuna live and invoices flowing automatically
- 2-3 additional vendors live by end of Q1 2026
- 50%+ reduction in manual invoice entry
- Team time reallocated to reconciliation/review
- Zero invoice entry errors

### Initiative 4: Personnel & Process Improvements

**Status**: 🟡 IN PROGRESS - Root cause analysis, personnel changes being considered
**Owner**: Jason Pace / Jeri Snyder
**Timeline**: Immediate - changes needed before P12 close

**Problem**:
- Operations team consistently unable to execute properly
- Examples: cash tips to P&L, wrong GL codes, not following instructions
- Missing requirements, causing delays
- Escalating problems to client instead of solving
- Training hasn't improved performance

**Root Causes** (Preliminary):
- Possible wrong team assigned to account
- Process files may be overly complex
- Insufficient training or understanding
- Lack of ownership/problem-solving mindset
- Communication gaps

**Actions Underway**:
- Root cause analysis (Jason reviewing SOPs, Jeri reviewing files)
- Personnel evaluation (Jeri: "need to make sure we have the right team")
- Process simplification (Jeri: "files are a little complicated")
- Communication protocol changes (route through Jeri/Jeff first)
- Oversight increase (Jeri directly involved now)

**Process Improvements Needed**:
1. Cash over short - documented step-by-step process
2. Cash tips - clear reconciliation procedure
3. Leases - transition to LeaseCake
4. Month-end close - updated playbook and checklist
5. Escalation protocol - Jeri/Jeff filter before client contact
6. Quality checks - review before submission to client

**Success Metrics**:
- Right team in place and executing properly
- Zero issues escalated directly to client (all through Jeri/Jeff)
- 10-day close achieved 3 months in a row
- No work falling back to client
- Proactive issue identification and resolution

### Initiative 5: Credit & Contract Resolution

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED - Full credit approved Dec 30, 2025
**Owner**: Jason Pace
**Timeline**: Approved Dec 30, procedure pending from CFO

**Request**: 1 month credit (~$10,000 for November 2025) - **APPROVED**

**Approval Details:**
- **Date Approved**: December 30, 2025
- **Amount**: Full one-month credit (~$10,000)
- **Approved By**: CFO (Yogesh) and CEO (Nate)
- **Communicated To**: Paul Hurley and John Lavigne (12:23 PM ET, Dec 30)
- **Next Step**: Waiting on CFO to confirm application procedure
- **Client Response**: Paul out until Jan 2 (out-of-office auto-reply received)

**Rationale**:
- Client paid for services not delivered
- Client performed work themselves (leases, cash over short, schedules, etc.)
- P11 close delivered Dec 23 (should have been mid-December)
- November invoice in dispute
- Client time investment exceeds $10k value
- Contract breach by Quatrro (10-day close not met)

**Client Position**:
- Prefer simple: one month credit, move forward
- Don't want to spend time on 90-day analysis
- Just want it fixed going forward
- "We could be asking for more, but this keeps it simple"

**Quatrro Process**:
- Jason met with CFO (Yogesh) Dec 23 morning
- Amount requires CEO (Nate) approval
- CFO may request 90-day analysis from team
- Jason submitted client's request as "estimate"

**November Invoice Situation**:
- Draft pending in client's account (auto-draft)
- Client considering not paying (breach of contract discussion)
- Positive pay exception needs decision
- Contract has dispute process for non-payment

**Resolution**: ✅ **Option 1 Selected - Approved immediately**
1. ✅ Approve $10k credit immediately (client preference) - **COMPLETED**
2. ~~Request 90-day analysis, delay decision~~ - Not pursued
3. ~~Negotiate different amount~~ - Not needed
4. ~~Client exercises contract dispute process~~ - Avoided

**Outcome**:
- ✅ Credit approved quickly, demonstrating commitment
- ✅ Avoided lengthy analysis and dispute process
- ✅ Client preference honored (simple resolution)
- ⏳ November invoice situation to be finalized when Paul returns Jan 2
- ⏳ Application procedure pending from CFO (Yogesh)

- 🎯 Feb 15: LeaseCake fully implemented
- 📊 Feb 15: EDI status review (Kuna + others)
- ✅ Feb 28: 60-day remediation review

### March 2026

- ✅ Mar 31: 90-day remediation complete, relationship evaluation

## Retrospective (In Progress)

### What's Working
- Jeri's engagement and commitment to understanding/fixing issues
- Jason's executive involvement showing seriousness
- Client's willingness to collaborate on solutions (not just leaving)
- Clear identification of problems
- LeaseCake solution will remove major pain point
- EDI strategy is sound (just need R365 to execute)

### What Went Wrong
- Operations team unable to execute basic accounting tasks
- No quality control before work went to client
- Allowed problems to compound over 14+ months
- Account manager changes caused continuity issues
- SOPs may be inadequate or not followed
- No escalation when team couldn't complete work (just sent bad work to client)
- Under-resourced or wrong team assigned to account

### What Could Be Improved
- Earlier escalation when problems emerged
- Regular account health checks
- Better team/account fit assessment
- Proactive process improvement vs reactive
- Client communication (more transparency about challenges)
- Quality review processes
- Training and capability assessment before assigning complex accounts

### Lessons Learned (Ongoing)
- Don't let service issues compound - escalate early
- Wrong team can't be fixed with more time - need right team
- Client patience has limits - act before it's too late
- Automation only helps if processes are sound first
- Executive involvement needed when relationship at risk
- Credit/financial remedy important but fixes more important
- Must deliver on commitments once made (LeaseCake, EDI, etc.)

## Success Factors

### Must-Haves (Non-Negotiable)
1. ✅ Fix cash over short process before P12
2. ✅ Personnel changes if current team can't execute
3. ✅ P12 close completed by Jan 11 (10 business days)
4. ✅ LeaseCake implemented by mid-Feb
5. ✅ No more work falling to client
6. ✅ Proactive communication (through Jeri/Jeff)

### Important (High Priority)
1. ✅ Credit approved and applied
2. ✅ Kuna EDI live
3. ✅ 3 consecutive 10-day closes
4. ✅ Client confirms continued partnership
5. ✅ Root cause fully understood and fixed

### Nice-to-Have (If Possible)
1. 4+ vendor EDIs live
2. Turn into positive case study
3. Additional automation improvements
4. Proactive process suggestions from team
